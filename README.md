# Machine Learning Internship at Codsoft

## Overview
This repository contains the projects completed during my machine learning internship at Codsoft. The tasks involved working on various machine learning problems using datasets from Kaggle. The main projects included:

1. **Movie Genre Classification**
2. **SMS Spam Prediction**
3. **Customer Churn Prediction**

## Projects

### 1. Movie Genre Classification
- **Description**: This project involves classifying movies into different genres based on their features.
- **Dataset**: The dataset used for this project is from Kaggle. It includes various attributes related to movies.
- **Techniques**: Various classification algorithms, feature engineering, and evaluation metrics were used to achieve the best performance.

### 2. SMS Spam Prediction
- **Description**: The goal of this project was to build a model that can predict whether an SMS is spam or not.
- **Dataset**: The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle, containing SMS messages labeled as spam or ham.
- **Techniques**: The project utilized text processing techniques, such as tokenization and TF-IDF, and classification algorithms to classify messages.

### 3. Customer Churn Prediction
- **Description**: This project focuses on predicting customer churn to identify customers who are likely to leave a service.
- **Dataset**: The dataset for this project is obtained from Kaggle, containing information about customer usage and behavior.
- **Techniques**: The project involved preprocessing data, feature selection, and applying classification algorithms to predict customer churn.
